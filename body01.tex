\chapter{Motivation}

Prozessorientierung ist eine nicht mehr wegzudenkende Maxime in der Gestaltung von Unternehmen. Sie ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Forschung in der Be- triebswirtschaftslehre und der Wirtschaftsinformatik.

Process orientiation is a precept in business organization. It is an essential part of research in business adminstration as well as \acrfull{IS}. To make use of it, models as the language of \acrshort{IS} take an important part. In particular, the reference models support businesses in these reorganization projects. They guide the user and help to incorporate best and common practices so that there is solid foundation to customize the model for the businesse's originalities.  

Outsourcing customer service to external providers is a common practice throughout many industries. Dialling a contact number for a service request often ends up with talking to a service agent anywhere around the world. Several companies have specialized to provide professional customer support using various contact channels. Providing customer relationship management (CRM) as service requires the careful and cost-efficient deployment of contact centres. Such centres are often staffed with hundreds of agents that must be hired and trained before customer contact.
For years, special focus has been put on the voice channel (Loudhouse, 2013). Meanwhile digital trends have affected many areas of life, which implies new challenges in customer relationship management. A recent study revealed that 78.7\% of call centre operations managers point out that their current systems fail to meet future needs, as they are telephone-centric and costs for an architecture overhaul are too high (Dimension Data, 2015). Nowadays consumers can use a plethora of devices and software applications to interact with organizations (Köffer, Ortbach and Niehaves, 2014). As a result, the number of used channels to reach organizations increases. More specifically, analysts have seen a move from the traditional voice channel to digital channels, such as chat or social media. For instance, private instant messengers offer faster and less complicated ways to interact with the company. Digital channels in contact centres now take 42\% of overall interactions and are said to overtake voice by the end of 2016 (Dimension Data, 2016). To this end, multichannel CRM has become a “must-have” for customer service management providers (Agnischock et al., 2015).
In this context, the term omnichannel CRM is increasingly dragging intention. Omnichannel CRM can be distinguished from multichannel CRM by not only providing multiple channels for customer interaction but also through seamless integrations of various channels and their underlying data (Verhoef, Kannan and Inman, 2015), which is a difficult task in CRM. At this point in time, omnichannel CRM is often not realized. However, customers more and more expect that they are able to switch between interaction channels without the loss of information. Contact centre interactions will often require the customer to repeat information again, although he or she has earlier written an email or a chat message to the same company.
Omnichannel CRM also comes with important benefits for organizations. Integrated data throughout various channels allows getting a better understanding of the customer’s profile and wishes through analytical support. Still, 40\% of contact centres have no data analysis tool in place despite of being named the top factor to shape the industry in the next five years (Dimension Data, 2015). 
To this end, organizations can better target marketing campaigns or increase the quality of service provision. To realize this, organizations that use outsourcing need close relations to outsourcing providers, since the integration of channels affects various information systems both at the organization but also at the outsourcing provider. More specifically, CRM business processes need to be harmonized since they often span organizational boundaries.

	\section{Reference Modeling}
	%%%%%%%%%%
		%%%%%%%%%%
		\subsection{Concept}
		Reference Models can be seen as theory of information systems \cite{Schutte1998}. A model itself is defined as an "immaterial representation of an original for the purposes of a subject" \citep[\p{1}]{Becker2012Gom}. Based on the work of \cite{Stachowiak1973}, three characteristics of models are identified: mapping, reduction and pragmatism.  Mapping describes the representation of natural or artificial originals, which can be models themselves. Reduction underlines the omission of certain elements of the original in a model. Pragmatism means that the selection of parts of the original is dependent on the intent of the model. Based on this notion, models of information systems (or information models in short) are explicit models that have information systems as subject matter. Information modeling, the act of creating these, is a complex task, which is why reference models provide a useful means to reduce the effort \cite{Becker2007}. \cite{thomas2006refmod} compiles various definitions for reference models. 
		
		%mehr auf definitionen eingehen
		For this thesis, a reference model is defined as an information model with content that is reused in the construction of other information models \cite{Becker2004}.
		
		Companies show growing individuality in their processes with increasing granularity. A reference model therefore needs to be as precise as possible, while maintaining the claim of being reusable. Approaches to find \textit{the} reference model that encompasses various domains stand in contrast to practical use, as the application of a very general reference model gets more and more effortful due to its abstract and theoretical nature \citep[\p{79}]{Schutte1998}. Striking a balance between these trade-offs is known as the reference modeling dilemma. The literature shows, that a defined application domain is a necessary ground for fruitful reference modeling.
		
		  %delfmann: Variantenmanagement
		  
			%grafik aus refmod - enzyklopädie vom brocke
		A model is always created by one or multiple subjects. This group shall be called designers and is in the context of reference modeling responsible for the reference model itself. The designer implements requirements from the reference model user. The idea behind is \textit{design for reuse} in contrast to application model side, where \textit{design with reuse} is the prevailing concept. There, one can identify an application model constructor and application model user. Akin to the reference model designer, the constructor takes requirements from the application model user. The difference is that he uses the reference model as the basis for adaption. By doing this, the application can represent characteristics of the application environment, while still being conformable to the reference model. As time proceeds, the reference and application model evolve and change states. As the name suggests, reference model can be used in multiple application model construction processes as they are typically tailored to a specific domain,\enquote{\eg}, retail, manufacturing or supply chain management.

		Information models can focus on different aspects of information systems. Drawing from the  \acrfull{ARIS}, one could take five different perspectives on \acrshort{IS}: organizational,functional, data, output and process. These perspectives can be motivated by \textit{pragmatism} as a model characteristic. The complexity of reality is reduced in a model through abstraction from insignificant parts for the purpose. From an organizational perspective responsibilities may be of highest importance, while they do not take this role in the data perspective. There, on the other hand, other aspects are essential like data entities and their relationships. 
		
		
		% der Process
		\subsubsection{Process orientation}
		 The process view is located in the center of \acrshort{ARIS}, integrating information from the organizational, functional, output and data context. 
				
	
		
		\subsubsection{Selected Reference Models}
		
		The purpose of this section is to briefly present two different reference models that are used in practice: The \acrfull{SCOR} Model and the Retail-H. Both show a layer structure to manage complexity and both encompass a process reference model. 
		
		\acrshort{SCOR} allows modelling of supply chains. It is a process reference model with three detail levels. It was developed in 1996 and is now maintained by the Association for Operations Management \cite{APICS2015}. On the highest level, typically called regulatory framework, \acrshort{SCOR}  is based on six distinct management processes: Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return and Enable. While the regulatory framework assists in defining scope, the second configures the type of supply chain (Make-to-Order, Build-to-Order, Engineer-to-Order). On the thirds level these are decomposed into generic process steps (e.g., issue product). Even more detailed processes are considered company specific and therefore no part of the model. Furthermore, performance metrics are also defined on each level. 

		\begin{figure}[caption={SCOR Model}, label={fig:scor}]
		{	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/scor.pdf}}
		\end{figure}
	

		In the domain of retail, the Retail-H is a reference model that includes process, function and data models. Developed by \cite{Becker2004a}, it has been adapted to suit special segments of the domain (for instance eCommerce, Central Clearance, Central Settlement). 
		It is structured along four levels of detail: the regulatory framework, main processes, detail processes and process building blocks. The core of the regulatory framework is made up of three parts that form the H (a connection to the German word for retail: “Handel”). While the left part of the H describes the supply side, the right covers the distribution side. Both are connected through logistics. All of these core processes are business processes, the roof and foundation consist of support processes thereby making use of the framework reference design as proposed in \cite{Meise2001}. 
		Each segment on the regulatory framework is a main process, that has several main process steps and each of these is a detail process. The detail process steps are process building blocks and show the highest level of detail.

		\subsection{icebricks as a Process Modeling Language}
		
	 Fundamental for a language is the ability to communicate through use of it. As this thesis focuses on process modeling, the  Basic concepts of a modeling language are tied to its purpose. Traditional modeling languages like EPCs, Petri-Nets or BPMN are very similar. Being a syntactical language, they offer large degrees of freedom in usage. What might look like an advantage at first sight, turns out to be disadvantageous. As process management approaches have increased number and variety of model designers and users enormously, more and more non-experts get in contact with process models and thus creating models of less quality. The definition of modeling conventions becomes necessary to help the modeler to conform to certain standards. A way to confront this challenge are the \acrfull{GOM}, which are an analogy to the \acrfull{GAAP}. However, conforming to these guidelines will lead to an increase resource requirements in these undertakings. The concept of semantic process modeling languages avoid this by enforcing additional rules that models have to follow. icebricks is one example that realizes this concept. In addition to syntactical correctness, \ie conforming to the language's meta model, other aspects are also considered which would otherwise be taken care of by combining \acrshort{GOM} and syntactical languages. Because the additional check for guideline compliance is unnecessary in semantic languages, they are more efficient. In the following the \acrshort{GOM} are described and it is argued why icebricks conforms to the aspects.

You can use the default \LaTeX \- functions for writing lists, \viz, \texttt{\textbackslash enumerate} for numbered lists and \texttt{\textbackslash itemize} for bullet point lists. Again, the \texttt{\textbackslash subsubsection} and \texttt{\textbackslash paragraph} can be used as structural elements, \eg, when listing definitions of terms.

\subsection{Footnotes}
Footnotes are contiguously numbered throughout the whole document. Use the \texttt{\textbackslash footnote\{text\}} command.  They appear on the page their reference is on \footnote{This is an exemplary footnote.}. Footnotes have to be placed without whitespace behind the word and within the sentence boundaries, \ie, before the period.

\subsection{ToDo-Notes}
You can use ToDo notes using the \texttt{\textbackslash todo\{text\}}  command. Please make sure to remove any ToDo notes before handing in your thesis! \todo[inline]{ToDo: Remove me before publishing}

\section{Formatting Text}

\end{table}


\section{Figures}

The \texttt{figure} environment is wrapped around images. These images should either be included as PDF-file via \texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics}, or created via \textit{TikZ/PGF}. For included images, make sure to use high-resolution images, preferably vector images.

Figures float, \ie, they do not necessarily appear at exact the same position you have defined them. Make sure to set a  \textit{caption} and an optional \textit{label} as figure parameters. 

\begin{figure}[caption={Relationship of students and theses}, label={fig:img01}]
	{	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{figures/figure01.pdf}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Subfigures}
Sometimes it might be handy to contrast figures, \ie, by placing them next to each other. The template uses the \textit{subcaption} package to provide subfigures. The following example contains two figures, where each subfigure has its own \texttt{\textbackslash label} and \texttt{\textbackslash caption}. Additionally, the whole figure has its own \textit{caption} and \textit{label}. That means, you can reference subfigures  \fig \ref{fig:subfig1} and \fig  \ref{fig:subfig}. Only the whole figure will be listed in the table of figures.

Subfigures are not limited to images, but may also include listings or tables. \Fig \ref{fig:subfig} shows a sample database query expressed in \ac{SQL} (\fig \ref{fig:subfig1}) and as query plan in relational algebra  (\fig \ref{fig:subfig2}).
 
\begin{figure}[caption={Exemplary use of subfigures}, label={fig:subfig}]

		\end{tikzpicture}
		\caption{Sample evaluation plan}\label{fig:subfig2}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}
\section{Listings}
You can use listings to typeset source code. This template uses the \textit{listings} package. Wrap code inside the \texttt{lstlisting} environment and set the \textit{language} (e.g., Java, SQL), \textit{caption}, and optional \textit{label} parameters. If the source code highlighting highlights the wrong keywords or misses keywords, use the \textit{deletekeywords} \resp \textit{morekeywords} parameters. Consult the package documentation for further information.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htp, caption={Euclid's GCD algorithm implemented in Java}, label={lst:euclid}, language=Java, deletekeywords={}, morekeywords={}]
public class Euclid {

	public static int gcd(int p, int q) {
		if (q == 0) return p;
		else return gcd(q, p % q);
	}

}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Algorithms}
Some users might require specifying algorithms. This template uses the \textit{algorithm}, \textit{algorithmicx}, and \textit{algopseudocode} packages. Consult the respective manuals for further information. Algorithms do not appear in a table at the beginning of the document, \ie, there is no list of algorithms.

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Require nonnegative integer $a$, nonnegative integer $b$
		\Function{Euclid}{$a, b$}
		\If {$b = 0$} \Comment{comment}
		\State{return $a$;}
		\Else 
		\State {return \textsc{Euclid}$(b, a\mod b)$;}
		\EndIf
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{Euclid's GCD algorithm in pseudocode}
	\label{alg:garbage}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Acronyms and Abbreviations}
This template provides comprehensive support for acronyms and abbreviations. The template uses the \textit{glossaries} package. 
Please do only define abbreviations and symbols that are uncommon. That means, common abbreviations such as \enquote{\eg} or \enquote{\ie} should not be listed. Abbreviations and symbols are sorted automatically by their label. 

\subsection{Common Abbreviations}
Please note that each full stop in a common abbreviation should be followed by a non-breaking space. This template comes with a variety of macros for common abbreviations, that can be used throughout your theses. The macros differ for English and German theses. Please see the tables below.

\begin{table}[caption={Common abbreviation macros for English theses}, label=tab:macros1]

	\end{tabular}
	\end{subfigure}
\end{table}

\subsection{Custom Abbreviations}
Custom abbreviations are defined in the \path{acronyms.tex} file, using the \\
\texttt{\textbackslash newacronym[longplural=\{<long plural>\}, shortplural=\{<short plural>\}]\\ \{<label>\}\{<short>\}\{<long>\}} command. The \textit{longplural} and \textit{shortplural} parameters are optional. The abbreviations are sorted by their labels. The label is furthermore used to reference the abbreviations in your text. You can do so using commands listed in \tab \ref{tab:glossaries}. In most cases, you just use \textbackslash gls\{<label>\}. On the first occurrence, the full version is displayed, \eg, \acrfull{ERCIS}. Afterwards, the short version will be displayed, \eg, \acrshort{ERCIS}.

You pluralize your abbreviation by adding a \texttt{pl} to the \resp command. This will add a small s to the abbreviation, \eg, \acrshortpl{CD}. \Tab \ref{tab:glossaries} shows custom short and long plural versions of the abbreviation \acrshort{kmu}. You might need this \esp for more complex German abbreviations that do not have a \enquote{s} plural form.

\begin{table}[caption={Commands for printing abbreviations}, label=tab:glossaries]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
		\toprule
		{\bf Command} & {\bf Result} \\ \midrule
		\textbackslash gls\{<label>\}     & \textbackslash acrfull on first occurence, \textbackslash acrshort otherwise \\
		\textbackslash glspl\{<label>\}       &  \textbackslash acrfullpl on first occurence, \textbackslash acrshortpl otherwise \\
		\textbackslash acrshort\{<label>\}       & \acrshort{kmu} \\
		\textbackslash acrshortpl\{<label>\}       & \acrshortpl{kmu} \\
		\textbackslash acrlong\{<label>\}       & \acrlong{kmu} \\
		\textbackslash acrlongpl\{<label>\}      & \acrlongpl{kmu} \\
		\textbackslash acrfull\{<label>\}      & \acrfull{kmu} \\
		\textbackslash  acrfullpl\{<label>\}     & \acrfullpl{kmu} \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Only referenced abbreviations will be added to the list of abbreviations.

\subsection{Symbols}
If required, you can define symbols in the \path{symbols.tex} file, using the \\ \texttt{\textbackslash addsymboltolist\{<symbol>\}\{<label>\}\{<name>\}} command. The symbols are sorted by their labels. Please note, regardless of using the symbols in the text, all symbols defined in the symbols file will be output to the list of symbols.

\section{Citations and Bibliography}
This template uses {BibTeX} for bibliographies. It comes with the MISQ style that takes care of proper formating and sorting of your references. Of course, you have to maintain a clean \path{.bib} file that caters all necessary attributes. References will appear in the alphabetical order of the surname of the first author. In case of several works by the same author, they are sorted by year.

Citing in the text is done with the \textbackslash citep[<before>][<after>]\{<citekey>\} command. Citations without parenthesis are done with \textbackslash cite\{<citekey>\}. You can reference authors with \textbackslash citeauthor\{<citekey>\}. However, we suggest typesetting authors in \textsc{Small Caps}, \eg, \textsc{\citeauthor{Hammer2015}} is one father of \ac{BPM}.

\paragraph{Exemplary citations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{BPM} is an integral management paradigm for building and running effective and efficient organizations  \citep{Hammer2015, VomBrocke2014a}.
	\item A holistic approach to \ac{BPM} goes beyond process modeling and workflow management systems \citep[\p{530}]{VomBrocke2014a}.
	\item See \cite{VomBrocke2014a} for a comprehensive review on \ac{BPM} best practices.
	\item \textsc{\citeauthor{Hammer2015}} lists organizational capabilities for \ac{BPM} \citep[\cf][\pf{9}]{Hammer2015}, while \textsc{vom Brocke} \etal give principles of good \ac{BPM} \citep[\cf][\pp{530--546}]{VomBrocke2014a}.
	\item Two authors are automatically divided by an \enquote{and} in English or an \enquote{und} in German, \eg, \citep{Becker2011}.
	\item \enquote{\ac{BPM} can provide a solid set of capabilities essential to master contemporary and future challenges} \citep[\p{534}]{VomBrocke2014a}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Misc}
The name and matriculation number of the student will automatically be displayed on the header of every page when the thesis type \textit{seminar} is selected.

\chapter{Compiling the document}
In order to generate a PDF-file from your \TeX-file you have to run the following commands. We assume you have a master file \path{00_thesis.tex} that you want to typeset.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htp, caption={Commands to compile this document}, label={lst:compiling}, language=bash, morekeywords={pdflatex, bibtex, makeglossaries}]
pdflatex 00_thesis
pdflatex 00_thesis
makeglossaries 00_thesis
bibtex 00_thesis
pdflatex 00_thesis
pdflatex 00_thesis
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, you can use your favorite task runner. This thesis comes with a \textit{Grunt} file to kick-start your \LaTeX writing.

When running, Grunt will monitor your thesis and on file changes, the PDF-file is automatically rebuild using the commands from listing \ref{lst:compiling}.
 
Please make sure to have node.js and the \gls{npm} installed. Now you can open a command prompt at the document root and run the commands in listing \ref{lst:grunt}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[float=htp, caption={Installing and running Grunt}, label={lst:grunt}, language=bash]
# Install Grunt via npm (use sudo on Unix-based OS)
npm install -g grunt-cli

# Install Grunt plugins / dependencies
npm install

# Run the Grunt listener 
grunt
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Known Issues}
Under some configurations on Windows machines, the \texttt{makeglossaries} command silently fails, which results in empty lists of accronyms and symbols. Same goes for the implicitly called \texttt{makeindex} command. In this case, you have to install \texttt{Perl}\footnote{https://www.perl.org/get.html} on your machine.
