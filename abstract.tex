Outsourcing customer relationship management processes is a common practice in many industries, but providers are challenged with increasing complexity and number of channels. While strong process capabilities are necessary, there is no framework to explain distinguishing characteristics of their business, especially in providing multi- or omnichannel services.

 The thesis draws on existing knowledge of reference models, BPO and CRM to build a model and demonstrates it on a global player in the domain, Arvato.
