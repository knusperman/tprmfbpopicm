\acrshort{DSR} demands a use of the artifact in at least one use case. In case of reference modeling, the model's purpose in practice is its application on a company in the form of an application model. 

Arvato, introduced in chapter \ref{chap:case}, is subject to the instantiation of the domain reference model to a provider model (\cf \Fig \ref{fig:modellevels}). The provider model intentionally embodies individual characteristics, so that changes to the domain reference model are inevitable. These changes specialize, but do not contradict research in this thesis. 

Documents and interview transcripts are foundation of the following practical exhibition. The interviewees were asked open questions about their business understanding and the reference model was not used to structure the interview in the first place. Consequently, their statements now have to be located in the model. 

	\section{Process Framework}
	
	Following a top-down structure, the starting point is the most abstract level of the model.
	 \Tab \ref{tab:interv} gives an overview about covered aspects in interviews. The interviews cover all processes, except \textsc{Inbound Service} and \textsc{Outbound Service}. For these, results from the process modeling workshop are available. The author was part of the workshop and conducted all interviews.

	Regarding the overall split into management, client and customer processes, interviewees conveyed that Arvato divides into global and local responsibilities.
	Interview partners in a global role reflect on differences between country organizations, while a local view is scoped within a country organization. Managerial processes were found on a global level. Client and customer processes were discussed from a global and local perspective. Product orientation of Arvato and its competitors was affirmed in the interviews. 
	
	 The provider model is shown in \Fig \ref{fig:arvatofram} and detailed in the remainder of this chapter.

	\section{Customer Processes}
	
	Practical evidence for the four processes in this area is seen in the interview regarding self-services (relating to \textsc{Self-Services} and \textsc{Knowledge Management}) and the process modeling workshop (relating to \textsc{Inbound} and \textsc{Outbound Services}).
	
		\subsection{Inbound \& Outbound Services}
	Building on the workshop at one location covering multiple clients in tourism and financial services, a clear picture about operations in a contact center was captured. 
	As voice, video, email, chat, twitter and facebook interactions were covered, all four channel types introduced in this thesis (voice, mail, direct messenger, social) have been explored. As participating managers shared their perception on inter-personal service interactions across client businesses located at their site, an abstraction from client-specific details can be assumed. The outcomes of the workshop were generalized to approximate the detail level within the process reference model. \textsc{Inbound Service} and \textsc{Outbound Service}, as modeled in \ref{pr:inb}, \ref{pr:out}, cover more details than found in the workshop outcomes: As analytical support was very limited and no central customer database was existing, several reference model process steps have to be seen as optional in an application on this client case. However, as one specific client business is seen as a client model instead of a provider model, the supported optionality of process steps in icebricks protects integrity. An omission of these optional steps in the client model can be realized.
	
	\subsection{Self-Services \& Knowledge Management}
	The interviewee saw customer needs in center of \textsc{Self-Service}, which is aligned to the reference process. However, it was admitted that difficulties arise in a process representation, because the diversity of self-service utilization implies different procedures. The representation in this work corresponds to the \textit{maintenance} phase of self-service technologies, which follows the \textit{project} phase according to the interviewee. The latter describes the implementation of a self-service and can be seen as part of \textsc{Solution Design} and \textsc{Transition} in the reference model. However, the maintenance phase especially consists of back-end processes, that are covered in \textsc{Knowledge Management}. Explicitly the creation and maintenance of content \wrt customer needs was mentioned in this regard. The proposed split to case-, transaction-, and customer-related knowledge  in the reference process is hence supported regarding the \textit{case} dimension. However, customer- and transaction-related knowledge was deemed important in inter-personal services. 
	
	\textsc{Self-Service} is modeled from a system perspective, therefore it must adequately represent used self-service systems from Arvato. Chat bots and semantic search can be named to give a channel-integrated and stand-alone example. While a chat bot must perform the reference process for every message in a conversion, a single passing through the steps can represent semantic search. The abstract \textit{customer need}  object enables the demonstration of both applications in the reference process.   

	Regarding terminology, the notion \textit{next best action} shall be used instead of \textit{resolution} for Arvato.

	\section{Client Processes}
	By ordering the interviews regarding their relation to the outsourcing lifecycle, interview 2,3,9 and 8 can be named. \textsc{Solution Design} was part of interview 5,6 and 7 of \Tab \ref{tab:interv}.
	
	While the general structure of the framework is seen as applicable to Arvato, a customization is applied to emphasize strategic priorities of the organization. \textsc{Sales} is renamed \textsc{Consultative Selling}, as it was seen as differentiating Arvato from competitors. 
	
	\subsection{Consultative Selling}
	
	This approach puts more emphasis on proactive activities in pre-sales, which is seen in the first two detail processes (\textit{identify prospect} and \textit{approach prospect}). The following steps conform to \textit{Bid Management} at Arvato, where a detailed process description is existing that can be matched with the reference detail processes. For the provider model, this documentation is used to specify process building blocks (\cf Appendix \ref{app:salesbb}). 	The importance of the  \acrshort{RFP} is stressed by Arvato, which is conforming to the reference model. \textit{Perform due diligence}, \textit{negotiate contract} and \textit{create commercial deal} are not explicitly listed as parallel processes, but covered in the documentation. Contract creation is seen as part of \textit{Contract Management} at Arvato. 
	
	\subsection{Transition}
	
	Implementation or transition are used to describe the phase between a signed contract and start of final service delivery. As discussed in \ref{pr:tra}, it was affirmed that the process starts during contract finalization, which also supports a separate process on framework level. Due diligence was seen as an important supporting factor to plan with less uncertainty. A transition plan was not explicitly mentioned, but it can be assumed that information is compiled in one or more documents that structure the transition project. 
	
	The interviewee stated that the most important question in this process is about the location of knowledge and documentation, which is captured in the \textit{transfer business, people, process, technology} detail processes. The proposal to segment into people, process and technology was consented. In addition, the initial recruiting and training of \acrshort{CSR}s was named, which is found under \textsc{People Lifecycle Management} in the reference model. 
	
	While \acrshort{PMO} and \acrshort{TMO} phase were not explicitly mentioned, their concepts were expressed during the interview. It was stated that it is recommended to start the transfer without further changes (corresponding \acrshort{PMO}). After this phase, optimization of status-quo (\ie, \acrshort{TMO}) can be initiated. 
	
	\subsection{Account Management}
	 \textsc{Sales} and \textsc{Account Management} can be linked together in country organizations inside Arvato. This view was taken in interview 8 and therefore a scoping of process boundaries was necessary. The starting point of \textsc{Account Management} was seen at the latest with signing of the contract and therefore exists during \textsc{Transition}. Constituents of the reference process were named in the interview, namely service performance monitoring, contract management and especially relationship management. The interview emphasized change management, that is not explicitly modeled as a detail process, but captured in \textit{manage disputes}, \textit{propose innovation} and \textit{renegotiate contract}. As a lifecycle analogy was stated, \textit{end contract} is a suitable last detail process. 
          
   	\subsection{Solution Design}
	\textsc{Solution Design} as a process in the reference model corresponds to the field of action of a same-named \textit{organizational unit} within the German Arvato organization. This unit also influences \textsc{Consultative Selling} through conducting proactive pre-sales activities, that are not part of this process. 
	
	The interviewee stated that starting point during pre-sales is the \textit{identification of potentials for improvement}, from which service requirements are derived.
	Then, with help of the product portfolio, a client-specific solution is created. The following development is conducted by IT. 
	
	Abstracting from organizational structure, one can state that the described process at Arvato is covered in parts of \textsc{Consultative Selling} and \textsc{Solution Design}. As intended by the modeling of a separate \textsc{Solution Design} process, it supports during sales activities. 
	
	The reference process starts with \textit{process service challenge}, that assumes challenges are identified in \textsc{Consultative Selling} and used in \textsc{Solution Design} to identify the problem. These challenges can be proactively 
	
	While the transformation towards a product-oriented organization is aimed, it was admitted that this is work in progress.
