%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter conceptions the process reference model and is central part of this thesis. In order to discuss particular processes, the framework itself needs to be discussed. What follows is the discussion of processes, which puts special emphasis on design decisions, \viz \textit{how} to model certain aspects by means of the language icebricks.

	\section{Process Framework}
	
	\citeauthor{Meise2001} defines a framework as \enquote{an ordering of relevant elements and relationships on a high level of abstraction. [...] Purpose is to give an overview about an original and to support structuring of elements and relationships on lower detail levels} \citep[\p{62}]{Meise2001}. Drawing further on his work, which especially targets framework design in process-oriented organizations, the proposed procedure for construction is adopted (\Fig \ref{fig:meise}). Differences to his approach arise, as the reference model displays an as-is state of the domain and does not follow goals of reorganization set by a specific company. Therefore, the \textit{organization} represents a fictive BPO provider in CRM in the following, which captures generic aspects of the domain. The construction is split into two components. The structural part first encompasses strategic and fundamental reflections, while the graphical component transfers these into a visual form that supports communication.

	\subsection{Set structural goals}
	
	Modeling is no end in itself and different purposes require different models. Theoretically speaking, purpose of this research is to create an artifact that generates utility and tackles a problem in the real-world.  Previously identified problems (\ref{sec:proide}) lead to objectives (\ref{sec:solobj}) which are to be faced with the process reference model in general and its framework in particular. The existence of general (organizational) and stakeholder-related objectives requires the framework to bring together both ends.

	\subsection{Set macro structure}
	
	A framework, as a strategic tool, incorporates concepts of strategy. One can name two perspectives, namely a market- or resource-based view of strategy, which are directed externally or internally, respectively. They are not independently of each other, but their interplay is seen as an important factor in strategic decision making. Literature criticizes that standardization through reference model application has contra-productive effects on strategic competitive advantages. \cite{becker2004handelsinformationssysteme} note that the argument is true, when the reference model is used as an application model. However, the application of the reference should incorporate strategic characteristics of the company. This reference model framework is designed in a way that generic strategic orientation for providers is incorporated. 
	
	The market-based view follow the structure-conduct-performance paradigm, that explains success of a company through external factors in the industry. \cite{porter1980} formulated the so called five-forces model, which describes bargaining power of suppliers (1), threat of substitutes (2), bargaining power of buyers (3), threats of new entrants (4) and industry rivalry (5) as determinants of competition. Applying these two the BPO domain, a trivial substitute for outsourced services is the return of services inside the parent organization. Further, the substitution of customer services through automation may render outsourcing obsolete. The bargaining power of suppliers and buyers can be loosely mapped to clients and customers. While clients as suppliers clearly influence the provider directly, customers show less of this influence on the outsourcing provider. As the provider takes an intermediate position between client and customer (\cf \Fig \ref{fig:bpochain}), their acting is always in connection with the client. However, an assessment of outsourced service quality puts pressure originating from the customer on the provider, which in turn will also be judged by the client. The entry of new players on the market (4) can be tackled by barriers, that go back to competitive advantages of differentiation or cost-leadership. While the latter is especially causing fierce competition in low-wage regions that realize offshore-outsourcing, outsourcing players in CRM that feature more profound services, lean towards a differentiation strategy. This can also be stated for Arvato. Lastly, industry rivalry among players in the BPO CRM market is also influenced by the aforementioned generic strategies, to position established companies. A framework adopts market-based aspects through accounting for markets or segments therein. These are accompanied by business units or processes that relate to this external environment. 
	
	The resource-based view of strategy \citep{wernerfelt1984resource} analyzes internal strengths and weaknesses. Resources are bundled to form capabilities and should be rare, inimitable, create value and be non-substitutable. Due to asymmetries of resources, competitive advantages are enabled. The identification of capabilities of CRM BPO providers (\cf \ref{sec:bpocrmis}: operational and business development capabilities) can only be done on a generic level for the reference model. Application necessitates specifying the framework to conform to company-specific capabilities. The operational capability should reflect the operational process component in CRM (\cf \ref{fig:crmprocessfr}), and service delivery from the outsourcing side (\cf \ref{app:provproc}). Business development, \ie understanding and addressing client needs, misses a pendant in an isolated CRM view, but can be put in relation to delivery management in the outsourcing model. 
	
	Putting both views together emphasizes the client and customer market environment and two capabilities, that relate to these markets. Towards the client side, providers are criticized by clients for being too reactive instead of proactive (49\%), delivering poor service quality (48\%) and lack of innovation (37\%) \citep{deloitte2014outsourcing}. While the first point of criticism addresses the client relationship, the other two are directed towards the service itself. Looking at the constituents of \acrshort{CRM}, the people, process, technology split draws a line to the resource-based view, as these three resources need to be developed and captured to enable superior service provision for clients. Apart from the  \acrshort{CRM} view, these three also have their own meaning in \acrshort{BPO}. \todo{Gross} The importance of processes in  \acrshort{BPO} is obvious. The people component can be interpreted here as the provision of manpower and their training for services; (information) technology as an enabler of outsourcing (\cf \ref{sec:bpo}) . 
	
		
	\subsection{Set process structure}
	\label{sec:procstr}
	Given that the model shows processes, the structural split of people, processes and technology is hardly meaningful, as two aspects of  \acrshort{CRM} or \acrshort{BPO} would be left out. Drawing from the BPO chain and the identified stakeholders enables another categorization that leaves room for design choices, while capturing generic aspects of business processes within \acrshort{BPO}. As \acrshort{BPO} is the framing construct and  \acrshort{CRM} one use of it, this order is to be prioritized. The following briefly describes business processes, that are detailed in the remainder of this chapter.
	
	
	\begin{figure}[caption={BPO chain provider scope with stakeholders}, label={fig:bpochainscope}]
		{	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/chain2.pdf}}
	\end{figure} 
	
	\subsubsection{Sales-related}
	Sales-related business processes cover processes that have touchpoints with the client. These take place along a lifecycle, which starts with initial contact between provider and client, and hopefully advances through creation of an outsourcing contract. For this agreement, the \acrshort{BPO} provider places its products (\ie, service blueprints) in the clients requirements profile to create solutions for identified problems. Also, the implementation and setup of the outsourced business must take place. After everything is set up, the client relationship is maintained under the umbrella of account management. 
	
	\subsubsection{Management-related}
	The management-related business processes bring together resources in the provider organization, so that the operations and business development capability are realized. Regarding the latter, it is important to have a products in place, which can be implemented as service solutions for clients.  \citep{schewe2007} names this delivery management, but explicitly refers to its similarities with product development. In addition to the development, the management of existing products inside a product portfolio becomes important. 
	
	Benefits through economies of scope are a question of offered services and not processes. The operations capability can be addressed by processes, that enable economies of scale. These are realized by the increased output of services across client businesses, which in turn necessitates alignment in these services so that their output can be counted \textit{together}. This alignment is facilitated through a product-view of services and their underlying portfolio in the organization. In addition, people in the provider organization need to be trained  in order to excel in the role of \acrshort{CSR}. Their career path can be seen from a process perspective, so that a strong relationship is established with their employer. This aspect shall be called People Lifecycle Management\footnote{The term people is preferred over agent or \acrshort{CSR}, because it puts this process strongly in connection \acrshort{CRM}. As the management-related processes are tried to be references for \acrshort{BPO} in general, this is not intended.}.  Lastly, management of the workforce, especially scheduling, becomes critical in a business like customer service. The assurance of the right capacity at the right time to meet fluctuating demand with little waiting time is expected from the client. Therefore, efficient techniques to manage the complexity of multiple channels, different demand patterns and different skilled \acrshort{CSR}s are necessary. This is encapsulated in the process of workforce management. 
	
	\subsubsection{Operations-related}
	The last group of business processes target the service delivery in the words of \citeauthor{schewe2007}. The processing of transactions with customers is in focus, which can be on numerous channels. A transaction in this case is a conversation, so that theories of communication \citep{shannon1949} may be used here.  A message is sent from a sender to a receiver through a medium. In case of customer service, both the customer or the \acrshort{CSR} can start a conversation, that has a subject which relates to the client in some way. Reasons for contact may be separated by being related to a previous transaction. This transaction might be a purchase of a client's good or service. The communication channel increasingly varies and is no reasonable split \todo{was für 1 split}, as in an omni-channel environment a seamless experience across channels is intended. Hence, the processes should be similar on a high level of abstraction. 
	
	Communication can be asynchronous (\eg, e-mail) or synchronous (\eg, voice), which puts emphasis on temporal differences in the conversation. While the employed process definition encompasses the \enquote{time-logical sequence of activities}, the value (\viz time between activities) does not impact the process logic itself, as this is a question of succession. General steps in inquiry handling from a business perspective will be similar independent of the (a)synchronous case. What becomes more important from a business perspective is the question after the contact initiator. A communication triggered by the customer (incoming) follows demand patterns that are inferred from historic data, while better planning of \acrshort{CSR} opened contacts (outgoing) is possible, as the temporal decision of contact lies at the business and not the customer. 
	
	Lastly, one has to differentiate in customer contact whether \acrshort{CSR}s are involved in inquiry handling, which obviously has business implications. When customers use self-service to address their needs, software takes the \acrshort{CSR} role, which saves resources. Providers can differentiate themselves through expertise in these systems. Clients save money by less volume that is processed by humans (employees of the outsourcing provider). At first sight, this may cannibalize outsourcing business, but the expertise of installing and running these self-service systems is likely not located in clients that outsource \acrshort{CRM}. Consequently, providers can generate new business by accumulating know-how in self-service activities. On the one hand, they design the customer-facing self-service in order to handle the inquiry (which by definition are customer-initiated). On the other hand, the provider manages and maintains the knowledge base, that sits behind these automatons in the back-end. This knowledge management does not only have implications on self-service, but also on other customer contacts, as the \acrshort{CSR}s in the human-to-human communication also query the knowledge base to solve customer problems.  
	
	It is desisted from the explicit modeling of a customer journey, because it encompasses components that cannot be part of a process model for providers. The model in this thesis is centered on the outsourcing provider. Modeling of a customer journey requires a customer-centric model, which then contains steps of the customer journey in a detailed way. Such a model should be a \textit{playground} for identifying space for improvement in dialog with a client regarding its customer journey. In addition, it would benefit from avoiding the standards of process models, as its purpose is seen in the \textit{design} of a journey through \acrshort{CRM} components. Research from the field of marketing can be a starting point \citep{Lemon_2016, Frow_2007}. 
	
	\subsection{Set design goals}
	
	The visual representation of the framework is linked to its cognition among viewers, therefore it needs to support the communication of the reference model's purpose. In contrast to language-processing, the process of perception is foregrounded, as the graphic is processed all at once and not sequentially. The model has to capture the fundamental characteristics of the domain of outsourcing at first glance. The sketched model level when applied (provider and client model) should be visually supported, as the framework of the reference is the blueprint to convey this hierarchy. 
	
	\hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1.2cm}
		\textbf{Design Goal 1}: The framework has to visualize the business of BPO providers.
	\end{minipage}

From a process perspective, as well as to reduce complexity, it helps to highlight important business processes over supporting or coordinating processes. By doing this, the viewer gets an impression about central parts of the model. 

	\hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1.2cm}
	\textbf{Design Goal 2}: The framework has to distinguish business processes from other process types. 
\end{minipage}

Furthermore, provisioned services are to be shown. In order to gain an understanding of characteristics in CRM outsourcing, especially in an omni-channel context, the framework has to clearly communicate their orientation towards the customer. As it is the differentiating aspect towards BPO for other processes, this fact could be incorporated in the design.  

	\hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1.2cm}
	\textbf{Design Goal 3}: The framework has to cover the CRM-orientation in service provision. 
\end{minipage}

A framework's purpose is to manage complexity by displaying relevant elements. In addition, the visual representation should be clear, consistent and structured to enable understanding on its own. 

	\hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1.2cm}
	\textbf{Design Goal 4}: The framework has to be easily processable by viewers without further explanation. 
\end{minipage}

	\subsection{Set design structure}
	
	The design of the reference model primarily addresses reference model users. However, its design will have large influence on the depiction of an application model. It is noted that the framework is designed independent of a process modeling language. The use of a reference design (model) can serve as a basis, as it includes benefits that have been previously discussed in context of reference models. The house reference design for example is used in the Retail-H (\ref{mod:retail}).
	
	Known patterns influence human perception \citep{kroeber1997} and can transfer associations. In case of the house reference design, one can link solidity, stability and security \citep[\p{216}]{Meise2001} with it. It is made up on three parts (\viz roof, core, foundation), which can be used to visualize coordination, main and supporting processes, respectively. The foundation represents a basis on which the house is built. Its main part, biggest in size, stands in the center and has the largest impact on the perception of the house's content\todo{ref becker}. The roof brings together underlying elements and has an analogy towards an organizational hierarchy. 
	
	\subsubsection{Framework composition}
	
	Adding the previously discussed process structure, supported by the BPO-chain design, one can convey this representation into the core area. \Fig \ref{fig:frameworkdesign} shows influences for the framework components. 
	\citeauthor{Meise2001} proposes the use of a value chain representation with a chevron that enables linking of multiple elements, which is called a \acrfull{VACD}. It communicates the input, transformation, output relation of a company, as the area on the left or right hand side of the house can be used to model supply or distribution markets. 
	These two markets are existing in BPO with end-customer interaction (like in \acrshort{CRM}), which nicely brings together house reference design and \acrshort{BPO}-chain. 
	
	\begin{figure}[caption={Framework design influences}, label={fig:frameworkdesign}]
		{	\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/frameworkdesign.pdf}}
	\end{figure} 
	
	
	The value chain can be represented by the exclusive use of chevrons that are linked together or it can have one starting element, which is a pentagon. This element is \textit{closed} to the left side in contrast to the \textit{open} chevrons. Porter uses the \textit{closed} variant, where the widened interface to the left side is emphasized. As the left side of the framework represents the client side, the strong link to the outsourcing partner shall be highlighted \wrt the customer-facing right hand side. Here, the interface to the customer shall be pointed for the following reasons. First, the interaction with a customer is intended to be independent of communication channel, so that the idea of omni-channel is conveyed (and with it the \textit{one face to the customer}-paradigm). Second, the customer-centric idea is communicated with this representation, as all actions towards him (the complete height of the chain) is pinpointed towards one customer. The process structure of three elements consequently locates sales processes on the left and starting part of the value chain and connects the operations processes with it, so that the client and customer side is represented. The value chain is deliberately wider than the house to make its function as an interface to the adjacent markets clear. The 
	
	The management processes are located above the value chain and spans the complete width of the house. While it is part of the core, it does not have a \acrshort{VACD} representation, as it has little contact with the the client or customer. However, it influences the complete part of business and is a indispensable part of the \acrshort{BPO} provider business, hence it must be part of the core instead of the roof. Sales processes benefit from the product and portfolio management, while workforce- and agent-related processes are scoped towards service delivery and with it operations. Reason for locating it at the top of the \acrshort{VACD} is that these processes include tactical to strategical aspects, that influence the underlying processes in the framework's core. 
	
	\subsubsection{Framework details}
	
	Locating the identified processes on the framework needs to be done carefully, as their position and shape is important for the viewer's perception. The three areas of the framework's core narrow down positioning alternatives. Their size and shape is equal, to emphasize their main process feature. Customer facing processes vary slightly. Support and Coordination processes have a smaller boxes, font size and slimmer boarders to limit their attention. \Fig \ref{fig:framework} shows the framework.
	
		\begin{figure}[caption={Framework}, label={fig:framework}]
		{	\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{figures/framework.pdf}}
	\end{figure} 
	
	
	 Starting with sales-related processes, the main processes Sales, Solution Design, Implementation and Account Management have to be placed on the framework. As explained in \ref{sec:procstr}, they follow a life cycle, so that \textit{Sales} leads to \textit{Solution Design} and \textit{Implementation}, while existing clients relationships are cared in account management. This leads to a positioning of Sales as the leftmost and \textit{Account Management} as the rightmost process within the sales area. Implementation and Solution Design are processes that take between the previous ones. They are both part of the setup of a business and are hence located next to each other. 
	 
	 Operations processes have the peaked customer interface as starting point for locating processes. These are split into \textit{inbound}, \textit{outbound} and \textit{self-service} as customer facing processes, that are accompanied by\textit{ knowledge management} as an process that takes place without knowledge of the customer. Consequently, knowledge management is located towards the center of the framework and less directed to the customer. The other three processes share their direct customer contact and are therefore in the right part of the chevron. To emphasize their role as the interface to the customer, their representation is adjusted to link to the customer. Furthermore, they are also located on the same height in the flow of the chain to highlight that these are alternatives of contact. By making no distinction of channels on framework level, their equality of treatment is represented. Inbound is written on top, as it is the most important process by volume in among the three, when one sets focus on customer service.
	 
	 The four management processes are located next to each other in their area on top of the \acrshort{VACD}. The product and portfolio processes have higher connection to the client side, as these service products are sold to  clients. The \textit{product development} process has a stronger external relation, as new products should meet unsatisfied demands from the market. \textit{Portfolio management} on the other hand is an intra-organizational process that sets its focus on the provider. The other two processes, namely \textit{People Lifecycle Management} and \textit{Workforce Management} impact \acrshort{CSR}s. Their positioning can be reasoned through an higher impact of workforce management on the service delivering activities through schedules, plans and forecasts of customer demand. People Lifecycle Management on the other hand is again oriented towards the provider organization, because the management of human resources for service delivery is of direct interest for the provider, but not to the customer.
	 
	 Support and coordination processes are not further specified in this thesis. Their elements are inspired by general processes of companies that play a role in \acrshort{BPO}. Processes like accounting or marketing are obvious to fulfill financial regulations and position the provider on the market, respectively. \acrfull{BI} / Analytics captures the process of supporting the business through data-driven insights apart from implemented solutions, as well as to provide decision-support for management on a tactical or strategic level. The latter emphasizes especially the  \acrshort{BI} aspect and would also make a positioning in the roof considerable. However, analytics was added to this process as no clear border between the two can be defined in the literature  \citep{mertens}. \citep{Chen:2012:BIA} suggest the term \acrshort{BI} \& Analytics. Interpretation of the two notions will vary in an application, as it depends on the understanding in the target organization. IT supports the business through operation of systems (for instance in accounting, HR or for decision-support in management). HR manages people in the provider organization and is different from People Lifecycle Management, as it focuses on \acrshort{CSR}s, not personnel management in general. Sales Management as a coordination process is subject to planning of client businesses and verticals. It is located on the left side of the roof to move it closer to the sales processes. Strategic Planning guides the provider organization as a whole with a long-term perspective. It is located highest in the roof to emphasize its importance for the strategic management of the organization. Controlling completes the coordinating processes by supplying the management with information and overseeing the client businesses.

	 	\end{tabular}
	 \end{table}
 
	 
	 With the proposed framework shown in \Fig \ref{fig:framework}, the four design goals are achieved. Its fundamental structure with the \acrshort{VACD} shows encapsulates the BPO business and by exchange of the right chevron, one can apply the model to other domains than \acrshort{CRM}. The relevance of business processes is highlighted through use of the house reference design. The right chevron is suited to represent service delivery in  \acrshort{CRM} through focus on customer contact, while abstracting from explicit processes for offered services (products). These are contained in the product development, solution design and portfolio management process without specifying of measures. Naming these would conflict with the intent of a reference model, as these will be different for companies in the domain. A minimalistic two dimensional representation without additional distracting features such as color or varying fonts supports understanding of the framework. The different shapes are limited and the use of rectangles is preferred. Other elements, like the \acrshort{VACD}, are associated by the viewer and naturally convey the flow of the framework: the outsourcing client's \acrshort{CRM} is given to the provider, who then adds the value to the chain and sends it to the customer. It is noted that application of the reference model results in differences in content, but also in design (to conform to corporate design for instance). However, an empirical evaluation of this framework design was not conducted so statements about viewer's opinions are derived from design choices of the author. \todo{rephrase}
	 
	 The following dives into the process models below the framework. The icebricks language is used to meet solution objective 4 and hence the underlying structure below the main processes on the framework is composed of detail processes, which in turn have process building block underneath.

	There are several constructs by means of data, that encompass all means of contact to the outsourcing provider. First, every contact involves a customer that is asking for something or more generally put has a lack of information that should be addressed. This lack is possibly related to a product\footnote{Product here encompasses everything that is provided by the client to the market, \ie, services as well.} of the client (be it an actual purchase or solely the consideration), which is denoted as a transaction. Transactions also cover touch points like past customer service contacts or other events between the customer and the company. Together, these product-related and touch point-related transactions are determinants for forming a complete view of the customer. Transactions have a hierarchy, so that one transaction may have to a superior transaction. 
	
	Here, it is assumed that every transaction is related to a customer. Even if it is a new customer, the act of contacting implies a previous touch point with the company. It is noted that this transaction might be not known to the company. A customer can have multiple transactions. The contact happens as an inbound (customer contacts company), outbound (company contacts customer) or self-service (customer reaches company with no involvement of a \acrshort{CSR} ). 
	
	Knowledge bases accessible by the outsourcing provider contain knowledge that is able to address the customer's issue that is reason for contact. As these issues are classifiable, structuring them leads to business cases that describe the solution to a known customer problem. Examples can the cancellation of a booking, the termination of a contract or change of address. This listing reveals that business cases are very dependent on the business of the client and hence are not a valid criterion for structuring customer contacts in a reference model. Not every customer contact needs to relate to a case. The \acrshort{ERM} in \Fig \ref{fig:contacterm} shows the described circumstances around the contact. It also reasons the structuring of the knowledge management process.

	\subsection{Inbound}
	The associated object to this process in the \textit{inquiry}\footnote{inquiry is American English; enquiry is British English.}. It is preferred over \textit{request} as it emphasizes an investigation in an issue over the politeness during asking. It is defined as an act of asking for information \citep{oxfordenquiry, oxfordrequest}. In this case, it is the customer who is lacking information in some regard and contacts the company. A \acrshort{CSR} of the outsourcing provider attends to the matter. 
	
	Reflections on the structure of the process become especially important in case of an omni-channel environment. There are multiple contact channels, asynchronous and synchronous communication and generic reasons that lead to the inquiry. Rationale behind omni-channel process modeling must be to keep the structure channel independent as long as possible to enable alignment. To capture the peculiarities of the channels, the concept of variants is used on the lowest level to distinguish between mail, voice, direct messenger and social channels. Reasons for this split is that other discussed channels (Video, Website, App) can be included in others by means of a process view (video to voice) or are not a contact channel by means of inbound customer service. The website and app are gateways to other channels (direct messenger) or to self-service, but do not offer direct engagement with a \acrshort{CSR}. Variants can be added, so that other channels can be easily added to the model. While there are similarities between (a)synchronous channels, using these as variants forecloses capturing of channel idiosyncrasies, because the underlying process building blocks would be the same for a variant. 
	
	The detail processes are structured so that their steps apply to all channels. This structuring was found to be applicable among the participants in the process modeling workshop and is shown in \Fig \ref{fig:inbproc}. First, the detail processes are described without going into details of their channel-variants.

First, an inbound inquiry reaches is initiated by a customer and the connection with the receiving end is established. Before an interaction starts, the inquiry needs to be guided to a \acrshort{CSR}, which is known as routing in telecommunications. During this \textit{routing} process, information from the caller is processed, so that part of his needs can be inferred before the employee starts the conversation and time (and money) is consumed. On the other hand, time that the customer spends in the system before the conversation is not consuming scarce resources from the provider, so the pre-extraction of information usable to address his problem is desirable. At the end of routing, a \acrshort{CSR} is found that starts the conversation with the customer. In the \textit{preprocessing} step, the \acrshort{CSR} takes on the inquiry and consumes the information that is available from the routing, as well as transmitted by the customer. After this familiarization the \acrshort{CSR} can \textit{classify} the \textit{inquiry}, so that he knows how to map the individual inquiry of the customer to a case (if existent). The \textit{process inquiry} detail process engages the inquiry and ideally solves the problem. The last step involves a \textit{review} and closes the interaction. It updates data related to the communication and stores it in the knowledge base. As every detail process in \Fig \ref{fig:inbproc} has four variants, these are shown one by one in the following. 

\subsubsection{Route Inquiry}

Going into the specifics of the route inquiry detail process, \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:route} shows the four variants comprised of process building blocks. One can observe similarities 
across all variants, that especially in the beginning and end. During this step, no \acrshort{CSR} is actively involved.

A common Language is a requirement for communication and needs to be known to understand the content of the inquiry. While this is required across channels, differences arise in the following step: All variants except voice can analyze the inquiry. This analysis uses available information from the inquiry, \ie its content or channel-specific data to identify the customer and infer the customer's need. In voice the inquiry itself is not existent at this point, as the customer has not expressed it verbally. However, \acrfull{IVR} technology helps to extract information from the customer without active involvement of a \acrshort{CSR} and is a typical technology in contact centers \citep{Thomas:2009}. The distinction between voice and the other variants is reasoned by the fact that the other inquiries are text-based and therefore analyzable by common means, which is not the case for voice. As \acrshort{IVR} is a standard in customer service, the naming of a explicit technology does not create conflicts in terms of universal applicability. The amount of information processed by it varies. Simple systems might just record input from the customer typed in via the phone keypad(\textit{if you have  a question regarding X, please press 2}), while sophisticated systems do natural language processing.

The social variant includes an \textit{analyze environment} building block, which emphasizes the importance of the network's context in social media. The verb \textit{analyze} is again used to state automatism in this step. 

Asynchronous channels (\ie, mail, social) have a \textit{priorize inquiry} step, that work around the \acrshort{FCFS} processing of inquiries. This step is not seen for synchronous channels, as the customer actively waits for a \acrshort{CSR} to take care of his inquiry. However, as the \textit{select  \acrshort{CSR}} step takes into account several aspects, it is not said that \acrshort{FCFS} applies to synchronous channels. The selection of the  \acrshort{CSR} depends on the requirements of the inquiry (\ie, language and to that point known content of the inquiry). Means to narrow down the variety content-wise is the availability of different contact channel instances. For example, there could be a dedicated mail address for reservations and another one for bookings. The fit of inquiry requirements to agent skills is known as skill-based routing. \acrshort{CSR}s can be clustered in agent groups that are the right contact person for the inquiry, so that additional rerouting is avoided. The last process building block models the actual routing of the inquiry, as now the receiving  \acrshort{CSR} is known. This can be done with an \acrfull{ACD} technology\footnote{Despite its naming, the technology is able to route calls of other channels \citep{ccn2016} } which is able to take available client and agent information into account.


\subsubsection{Preprocess Inquiry}

This detail process, shown in \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:prepr}, begins with a \acrshort{CSR} entering the process, that consumes the available information of the inquiry. This is not possible on the voice channel. There, the agent needs to open the conversation first, followed by the listening to the customer. Then he obtains understanding of the problem and can checks whether the data form the \acrshort{IVR} is correct. The other channels, analogous to the route inquiry detail process, \textit{check analytical results} so that there is consensus of manually read inquiry content and analytically derived aspects.

In the same way, the social variant includes a manual verification of the environment in the network. As elements can be skipped if not applicable (\ie no analytical system in place to check the environment in the social network), this building block may be interpreted as a first check of the environmental situation. Contextual factors (related posts with the same issue) on the facebook wall for instance may require a different approach towards the inquiry to ensure the appropriate reaction of the company in public.   

The synchronous channels, \ie, \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:prepr:voice}, \ref{fig:inbound:prepr:dm} show time-logic differences. While the voice channel needs to open the conversation to know about the inquiry, a \acrshort{CSR} in a direct messenger communication is able to do the preprocessing step beforehand and opens the conversation to the customer at the end.

\subsubsection{Classify Inquiry}

\Fig \ref{fig:inbound:class} shows the four variants for the third detail process of the inbound process. One can see that there is no difference seen between asynchronous (top row) and synchronous (lower row), so it is possible to shrink the representation down to two variants or even one variant, as the \textit{request missing information} building block can be skipped in the icebricks language if not applicable. For the sake of consistency across all detail processes, the four variant split is preserved.

First, the available information of the inquiry and the analytical support from the two previous detail processes is combined to form one understanding of the inquiry for the \acrshort{CSR}. Next, mistakes of the analytical support are corrected, so that the system gets feedback and may improve in future.

Third, the \textit{ classify inquiry} building block connects the inquiry (up to here seen as an instantiation of an unknown case) to a class. This class is a known construct in the mind of the \acrfull{CSR} and ideally described in a knowledge base as a case. An example for this split is an inquiry by a customer a, that expresses his wish to swap his ticket of x on day y to day z. The \acrshort{CSR} can classify this inquiry as class \textit{change of booking}. With this link being established, the problem is understood by the  \acrshort{CSR} and inquiry processing can be commenced. 

Synchronous channels contain a \textit{request additional information} building block, that enables the \acrshort{CSR} to get additional information from the customer needed prior to classification(a booking number is required for a change of booking and not known). This is put before classification, so that a class can have requirements that need to be fulfilled before assignment. By this logic, the \acrshort{CSR} needs to have a guess about the customer's need, so that the right information is requested.  

This classification of the inquiry, \ie, the mapping of the customers individually expressed needs to a modeled case on company/provider-side is seen as the essential task of the \acrshort{CSR} here. If the case was correctly modeled and identified, in theory its process would be adequately represented by \acrshort{IS} and no human involvement from the customer service side would be necessary. 

\subsubsection{Process Inquiry}

The process inquiry detail process is shown in \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:proc}. It represents the addressing of the customer need, that was previously defined and classified. Similarities among all variants are the starting building block \textit{query knowledge base}. This models the \acrshort{CSR}'s lookup of information related to the case at hand, either to give the requested information to the customer or to look up the process to solve the customer's issue.  

Asynchronous channels, \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:proc:mail}, \ref{fig:inbound:proc:social}, contain a \textit{draft response} building block. Draft is used to enable the possibility of a following review step. Response on the other hand represents the asynchronous property of the communication. The response to the inquiry does not necessarily solve the customer's problem, as no conversation is included that verifies the correct understanding of the problem. Synchronous channels are assumed to solve the inquiry within the bounds of possibility. 

The models on the right side of \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:proc} both contain a \textit{check-privacy guidelines} and \textit{request channel switch} building block. As direct messengers or social networks are often platforms, operated by other parties that may have a different understanding of data privacy, certain business cases cannot be processed on these channels. Hence, a channel switch becomes necessary and ends the process. 

The voice channel additionally includes an identification segment, that represents the \acrshort{CSR}s ability to verify the customer's identity during the conversation. This does not represent the identification of the customer to an entry in the \acrshort{CRM} database, but a legally binding statement, that may be required for certain business cases. Video communication is a means to achieve the certainty of identity for the \acrshort{CSR}.
 A channel like mail lacks the ability to identify a customer, as everyone with access to the customer's account can send on his behalf. This represents knowledge at the time of writing based on current practice. In future, a legally binding identification over different channels might be possible, for example via social media profile.

\subsubsection{Review Inquiry}
\label{inb:review}
Review inquiry is the last detail process within the inbound process. Its four variants can be inspected in \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:revw}. Two meanings of the notion of review in the Oxford Dictionary \citep{oxfordreview} fit to explain the different variants. First, a review is a \enquote{formal assessment of something with the intention of instituting change if necessary}. This definition fits to describe building blocks in asynchronous channels mail and social. A \acrshort{CSR} might need to send a response to a supervisor for checking. The supervisor can change parts or approve it directly (called \textit{finalize} here). In social networks, the environment should be checked again, as it could have changed since compilation of the draft. Also, the submission of the response is called \textit{posting} to emphasize differences of public posting to private \textit{sending} of mails.

Synchronous channels (\cf \Fig \ref{fig:inbound:revw:voice}, \ref{fig:inbound:revw:dm}) show the same components, that are again not aggregated into one variant for consistency reasons. As they solve the inquiry during the synchronous conversation, no review according to the given definition is possible. However, second meaning of the term review explains the purpose of this step: \enquote{A report on or evaluation of a subject or past events}. 

This justifies the last two process building blocks of all three variants, namely \textit{update customer data} and \textit{update inquiry}. As the interaction is completed at this point (\viz the response is sent, posted and the synchronous conversation is closed), information from the customer contact is to be stored. On the one hand, the customer contact, seen as a touch point and therefore a transaction, is connected to the customer in the \acrshort{CRM} data base. Additional data that might be revealed during the contact can also be stored to enrich the profile by the \acrshort{CSR}. Furthermore, the inquiry itself can be updated to keep track of the customer's issue if not solved entirely. Ticket systems are a concept to model this matter. The system itself  keeps track of handling times and other measures of the inquiry, so that data for reporting is generated.

	\subsection{Self-Service}
	
	The third customer interaction process leaves inter-personal service \citep{Thomas2008self} and focuses on ways that enable the customer to be the main value-generating part in the service interaction. This is facilitated by a technological component which can relieve the customer of a varying extent of the problem. The following illustrates this continuum from a customer perspective: Simple self-services, like an \acrshort{FAQ} section offer answers to questions, which the customer has to select from a list. The customer must express the need, map it to the available information, select the appropriate answer and process its content. A more advanced self-service might be able to additionally support the customer by the expression of the need and takes care of the mapping by a textual input, which is a more natural way of communication. The textual is analyzed and algorithmically mapped to the most appropriate solution, which is then presented to the customer, who must consume its content and is hopefully satisfied. It is noted that both solutions address the customer's issue, but sophisticated \acrshort{IT} increases usability by an easier interface to the customer's issue and a computed provision of a solution. This addresses what \citep{Thomas2008self} names a minimal skill set, \viz the an increased usability decreases the minimal skill set that is required for use. 
	
	From literature \citep{meuter2000self, Thomas2008self, Thomas:2009}, one can identify characteristics of self-services, which need to be considered in a process. As in the model the perspective of the service provider is chosen, the process needs to hold aspects which are seen from a system perspective. The previous example features the differences between a simple and technological enhanced serf-service. In both cases, the system has to provide information, but the simple self-services required the capability to express the need in the language of the service system, while the second allowed the customer to express it more naturally. The system perspective implies that the more active the customer takes the part in the process (\ie the simpler the self-service is), the less parts of the process are carried out by the system. 
	
	Furthermore, a self-service can be seen as part of a another customer service process. One can think of a self-service as support for a inter-personal contact, when it provides solutions based on customer information. Examples for this are \acrshort{IVR} or generated chat messages based on customer input.
	
	Unlike inter-personal services, self-services cannot be structured \wrt a communication channel, as they can be part of a service within one or multiple channels, or stand-alone in a web-based setting. A process representation is chosen which models both a supporting self-service for other services and a stand-alone implementation.

	The process object customer need is chosen over inquiry to express the differences over inbound processing. It is noted that a customer need is an abstract construct that is used to express the customer's intention of use. However, like the inbound process self-service gets input from a customer and tries to solve the issue. But as there is no \acrshort{CSR} directly involved, there is less certainty that the system adequately addresses the \enquote{inquiry}. Due to this lack of a human counterpart on provider side, the technological interface provided by the system to the customer takes an important part in \textit{identifying customer needs}. As the capabilities of this interface vary drastically among different self-service scenarios, customer needs are chosen to emphasize the difference to inbound processing. \textit{Process customer needs} then aims at mapping the identified need to a defined solution in the knowledge base. After creation, \textit{present solution} communicates the findings to the customer. Lastly, \textit{evaluate solution} represents post-processing activities. The process is shown in \Fig \ref{fig:selfservice}.
	
	The building blocks of the four detail processes are summarized in \Fig \ref{fig:selfservice:detail}, as their is no further split into variants. The following description emphasizes the differences in simple and advanced self-service scenarios. 
	
	The building blocks of \textit{identfiy customer needs} (\Fig \ref{fig:selfservice:1}) capture external circumstances, that might be processed by the system to have more data available for inferring the customer need. Environmental factors are implicitly collected, \ie the customer does not need to state them. Request information models the input that the customer gives to the system. While the active phrasing might fit to more advanced self-service systems better than to simple \acrshort{FAQ}s, as the latter hardly asks the customer for information, the step applies to the concept of self-services: in order to narrow down the customer needs, relevant information needs to be selected by the customer (in a simple self-service system) or demanded as input for the system (in the advanced case). The verb \textit{infer} is used to describe the stochastic component of the system's attempt to understand the customer need. Again, the selection of a \acrshort{FAQ} entry by the customer might minimize the system's influence, still it conceives the selection as an information input and infers that the customer is \textit{needing} answers in this regard. An increased usability in the technological interface (arbitrary text input instead of a selection of options) also increases uncertainty in need identification, because the system has to select the fitting case by itself. 
	
	After the customer needs are inferred and hence available in a manner that corresponds to the data available in the knowledge base, the \textit{process customer needs} detail process (\Fig \ref{fig:selfservice:2}) receives  suitable information and creates a solution based on it. The solution represents the appropriate response to the customer's need. This can be the needed information, so that the need is completely addressed. Another option is that the self-service system can identify the need, but solving it requires personal-interaction. This expresses the limitations of service automation. 
	
	\textit{Present solution} (\Fig \ref{fig:selfservice:3}) conveys the result to the customer. The solution is presented by the system and is an adequate response to the customer's input. The customer's reaction is an important indicator of satisfaction and captured during the presentation. As the identification of a customer is not required for self-service use, these data needs to be stored in relation to the self-service input to further improve customer experience. The last detail process \textit{evaluate solution} (\Fig \ref{fig:selfservice:4}) can include a request for feedback (\enquote{Did this solve your problem?}) and finally all relevant information of the self-service use is stored and hence updates knowledge base.

	\subsection{Outbound}
		
		In contrast to inbound interactions that have an inquiry as central object of the process, the outreaching communications do not necessarily target a customer's issue. Its root depends on the purpose of the communication, which can be related to a previous interaction (call-back service in voice) or e-mail marketing (new offers via mail) for instance. Therefore, the general term \textit{contact} is used and defined as \enquote{a meeting, communication, or relationship with someone} \citep{oxfordcontact}. The verb refers to the communication with someone.
		
		Alike to inbound processing, omni-channel applicability is enabled by having a universal detail process, which has variants for each of the four contact channel categories. It is noted that outbound communication may apply differently across the channel types and dependent on implemented technology. There is the necessity of knowing the identifier of a customer within a contact channel to reach him. This identifier is the phone number in voice, mail address or a social media account. Direct messengers may be designed to enable use without individual sign-up, which excludes the ability to reach the customer. However, using direct messenger platforms such as WhatsApp enables outgoing communications, as work with identifiers.

		A fundamental difference the inbound and outbound process is that outbound contact is proactive and needs more initial information to act on, whereas inbound contact is more reactive \citep{DimensionData2015}. \Fig \ref{fig:outbound} shows the detail process, which is composed of three steps. As an analogy to the inbound detail process, the \textit{prepare contact} represents activities that take place prior to the activity that actually addresses the process object (route, preprocess, classify inquiry in the inbound process). The following \textit{contact customer} step expresses the active approach of the customer (contact) from the company side and can mirror the process inquiry step in the inbound process. Lastly, the \textit{evaluate contact} step contains subsequent efforts. Here the wording evaluate is chosen over review to put more focus on an assessment of the contact and less on the intention to change parts if necessary (\cf \ref{inb:review}). Furthermore, the company as contact initiator can perform a review at an earlier stage and does not need to react on a customer. 
		

		\subsubsection{Prepare Contact}
		
		To actively approach a customer, there has to be a trigger or decision that lead to the initiation of the process, which is then assigned to the executing organizational unit, \ie \acrshort{CSR}. The information that captures the intention behind the contact is assumed to be stored in the knowledge base. The first step of this detail process (\Fig \ref{fig:outbound:prep}) is consequently a query to get the \acrshort{CSR} informed, which is consistent over all channel variants. Next, the aforementioned reason for contact is processed by the \acrshort{CSR} to enable the transfer of it towards the upcoming contact of the customer. 
		
		All channels except voice show three blocks, that also appear in the review inquiry inbound process variant (draft, review, finalize message/post). This early (optional) verification by a supervisor is possible because the communication is started by the company and the purpose is stored in the known reason for contact. Therefore, there is no processing of a customer inquiry necessary on which a response is formulated. Because of this, direct messengers can also have these component, even though it is a synchronous channel. In the voice variant, there is no review. The \acrshort{CSR} is assumed to understand the reason for contact or resolve any issues with it in the \textit{process reason for contact} step, as the scripting of a call is implausible. 
		
		The case of a proactive post of a company on a customer's social profile might seem less typical on platforms like facebook, but it cannot be foreclosed. In addition, it depends on the social behavior on the network that might change over time and varies across networks.

		\subsubsection{Contact Customer}
		
		The second step of the outbound process models the approach of the client (\Fig \ref{fig:outbound:con}) . The use of contact as a verb expresses that the customer is on the receiving end. (A)synchronous channels show a similar structure, respectively. As the message or post is already prepared, the select of the sending account and the actual transmission\footnote{Theoretically, the second block in the social variant should be named \textit{post post}. Considering writing style, the object is kept and the verb changed to send. } is left. As previously justified, the variant in social media includes a verification step of the network environment. 
		
		Synchronous communication establishes a \textit{conversation} with the customer on which is responded in a timely manner. It is noted that in contrast to the voice channel, a direct message does not require the customer to respond directly to the \acrshort{CSR}s message. With this open connection, the  \acrshort{CSR} is able to \textit{communicate} the \textit{reason of contact} to the customer. 
		
		As the contact is initiated by the company, the customer might not understand the reason for contact properly. In this case of synchronous communication, it is possible for the \acrshort{CSR} to\textit{ solve complications} on the spot. The last block of the detail contact customer detail process encompasses the \textit{solving of }further \textit{questions}. Reason for this is that in the outbound case, there is object encapsulating the customer's need (as it is the inquiry in the inbound process). Ergo, the customer can have additional unresolved questions which can, but not necessarily have to, relate to the reason of contact. In analogy to the \textit{solve inquiry} block in inbound processing, the verb solve is again used to emphasize the activity of the  \acrshort{CSR}.

		\subsubsection{Evaluate Contact}
		
		This detail process step (\Fig \ref{fig:outbound:eval}) closes the synchronous conversation and represents closing activities that are related to the contact. Synchronous channels close the conversation at the beginning, while asynchronous channels are completed with posting or sending. Mirrored from the inbound process, the process building blocks \textit{update customer data} and \textit{update contact} draw a line to the review inquiry process. Here, the inquiry object is replaced by the contact object.
